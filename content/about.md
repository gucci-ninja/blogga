Hi, welcome to my blog! I like to write about anything tech-related that I find interesting. I'm passionate about making tech more accessible and I'm a big advocate for open source.

I graduated from McMaster University in 2020 with a degree in software engineering. Previously I've interned at Bell and volunteered for hackathons like DeltaHacks, SheHacks and ElleHacks. Right now I'm working at Guidewire, building scalable and reliable infrastructure!

Some other (non-tech) hobbies of mine are

- :notebook: bullet journaling
- :hammer: playing Minecraft
- :fork_and_knife: trying new food
- :cocktail: mixology
- :telescope: stargazing
