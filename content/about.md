Hi, I'm Suhavi Sandhu, but my online name is usually `gucci-ninja`. My pronouns are she/her. I'm a software engineer in Toronto, currently working at Guidewire, where I work on building scalable and robust infrastructure. On this blog I usually talk about my personal projects and tech-related topics that I find interesting. 

I graduated with a software engineering degree in 2020 and since then, I've been trying to find my place in the tech community. I love attending (virtual) conferences and speaking on topics that I am passionate about. I also enjoy volunteering at hackathons like DeltaHacks, SheHacks and ElleHacks. My goal is to make tech more accessible through my work and am a huge advocate for open source.

Some other (non-tech) hobbies of mine are

- :notebook: bullet journaling
- :hammer: playing Minecraft
- :fork_and_knife: trying new food
- :cocktail: mixology
- :telescope: stargazing
