Since my co-op starts next week I thought it would be the perfect time to set up my blog so I can document my experiences. I hope I can capture what I learn every week and reflect on my time as an intern. Maybe in a year I will be showing this to the new set of co-ops.

### My First Day at Bell 
I left my house early like any responsible employee on their first day of work and arrived more than half an hour early. After lots of waiting, the new interns (about 5 of us) were met by the current ones (4). My first impression was that the people at Bell are really welcoming. Everyone wants you to succeed and learn new things along the way.

My first task is to learn Ruby on Rails. So I'm going to be making a clone of Reddit. I've been tasked with a few UI changes, nothing crazy. I thought school is pretty useless but turns out that it actually helps that I learned about MVC architecture. Even though I have little experience, I'm not totally clueless.

### End of the Week
Even though the company went through a re-org and things are all over the place, it's not bad. The coolest part is getting to see new phones before release. I'm not super into phones (I have an iPhone 6, that came out 3 years ago) but I can appreciate a good phone when I see one. I got a Samsung Galaxy S9 as my work phone!

### Final Thoughts
I'm excited for my time at Bell and I like the freedom I have with what I get to work on. I hope that the people around me will be supportive and guide me.
