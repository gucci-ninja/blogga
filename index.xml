      <description>My First Day at Bell First Impressions I left my house early like any responsible employee on their first day of work and arrived more than half an hour early. After a lot of waiting and small talk, the new interns were met by the current ones. My first impression was that the people at Bell are extremely welcoming. Everyone wants you to succeed and learn new things along the way.</description>

      <description>Since my co-op starts next week I thought it would be the perfect time to set up my blog so I can document my experiences. I hope I can capture what I learn every week and reflect on my time as an intern. Maybe in a year I will be showing this to the new set of co-ops.</description>
