<h2 id="first-impressions">First Impressions</h2>

<p>I left my house early like any responsible employee on their first day of work and arrived more than half an hour early. After a lot of waiting and small talk, the new interns were met by the current ones. My first impression was that the people at Bell are extremely welcoming. Everyone wants you to succeed and learn new things along the way. My day comprised mostly of setting up accounts and machines, meeting new people and trying to remember names.</p>

<h2 id="my-roles-and-responsabilities">My Roles and Responsabilities</h2>

<p>This part was a bit uncomfortable. The things I had been told on the day of my interview, the orientation and my first day were all extemely different, as if no one was even sue what I am going to be doing. On my first day I was being told multiple things about my job by a lot of different people. It seemed that everyone had something different to say. &ldquo;Oh you&rsquo;ll be doing this! And this. And this and this and this.&rdquo; I was very confused and after a meeting with my manager(?) I felt a little bit more assured.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m excited for my time at Bell and I like the freedom I have with what I get to work on. However, I don&rsquo;t know if I like that there is no actual development that I will be assigned to. Essentially I feel like I will be making work for myself by noticing any improvements that can be made at Bell. I am confident that the people around me will be supportive and guide me.</p>
