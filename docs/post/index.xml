      <description>Hi everyone! This Thanksgiving my mom did an activity with her grade 2’s where they went around their virtual classroom listing things they were thankful for from A-Z. This inspired me to write my very first Medium article on technologies that I’m thankful for this Thanksgiving :) These range from tech I’ve used to tech I am interested in using in the future.
AWS I started using Amazon’s web services earlier this year to host a project.</description>

      <description>Since my co-op starts next week I thought it would be the perfect time to set up my blog so I can document my experiences. I hope I can capture what I learn every week and reflect on my time as an intern. Maybe in a year I will be showing this to the new set of co-ops.</description>
