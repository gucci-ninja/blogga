      <description>8 Tips for Effective Design Reviews I had a recent design review that caused me to self-reflect and come up with some practical technical and non-technical tips on some aspects that may be overlooked in design reviews (lower-level designs in particular).
Technical Tips 1. The S in SOLID In my lens, making code changes comes at the cost of introducing complexity. In order to reduce the complexity, I tend to lean towards modifying existing classes.</description>

      <description>Here is a beginner to intermediate tutorial for setting up a Flutter web app with Rive animations. I recently built a sliding tile game that incorporates Rive animations for the Flutter Hackathon. In this tutorial I’m going to show you how to add an animation to your Flutter web app and control it through user input.
We will create a basketball animation that will get triggered each time the user clicks on a button.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone! This guide is meant to take you through the process of setting up Arch Linux. It&amp;rsquo;s more of a set of guidelines rather than strict procedure. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to give new or potential users an idea of what it&amp;rsquo;s like to dual boot your computer with Arch Linux.
I started using Arch in 2018 after getting tired of Ubuntu and since then I have dealt with my fair share of problems (corrupted ISO, problematic updates, bluetooth nightmares).</description>

      <description>Hi everyone! Recently I made my first open source contribution and wanted to share my experience as well as any tips I have for developers getting into open source development.
Step 1 — Finding motivation Due to COVID-19, I realized how much we rely on technology to bring people together. Then I thought about how much of that tech is made possible due to open source. I feel so grateful that I have access to and the potential to contribute to all this tech.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone! This Thanksgiving my mom did an activity with her grade 2’s where they went around their virtual classroom listing things they were thankful for from A-Z. This inspired me to write my very first Medium article on technologies that I’m thankful for this Thanksgiving :) These range from tech I’ve used to tech I am interested in using in the future.
AWS I started using Amazon’s web services earlier this year to host a project.</description>

      <description>Since my co-op starts next week I thought it would be the perfect time to set up my blog so I can document my experiences. I hope I can capture what I learn every week and reflect on my time as an intern. Maybe in a year I will be showing this to the new set of co-ops.
My First Day at Bell I left my house early like any responsible employee on their first day of work and arrived more than half an hour early.</description>
