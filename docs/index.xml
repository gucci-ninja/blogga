      <description>Hi everyone! Recently I made my first open source contribution and wanted to share my experience as well as any tips I have for developers getting into open source development.
Step 1 — Finding motivation Due to COVID-19, I realized how much we rely on technology to bring people together. Then I thought about how much of that tech is made possible due to open source. I feel so grateful that I have access to and the potential to contribute to all this tech.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone! This Thanksgiving my mom did an activity with her grade 2’s where they went around their virtual classroom listing things they were thankful for from A-Z. This inspired me to write my very first Medium article on technologies that I’m thankful for this Thanksgiving :) These range from tech I’ve used to tech I am interested in using in the future.
AWS I started using Amazon’s web services earlier this year to host a project.</description>

      <description>Since my co-op starts next week I thought it would be the perfect time to set up my blog so I can document my experiences. I hope I can capture what I learn every week and reflect on my time as an intern. Maybe in a year I will be showing this to the new set of co-ops.
My First Day at Bell I left my house early like any responsible employee on their first day of work and arrived more than half an hour early.</description>

      <description>Hi, welcome to my blog! I like to write about anything tech-related that I find interesting. I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about making tech more accessible and I&amp;rsquo;m a big advocate for open source.
I graduated from McMaster University in 2020 with a degree in software engineering. Previously I&amp;rsquo;ve interned at Bell and volunteered for hackathons like DeltaHacks, SheHacks and ElleHacks. Right now I&amp;rsquo;m working at Guidewire, building scalable and reliable infrastructure!
